/*You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.
Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

    Root: If node is root node.
    Leaf: If node is leaf node.
    Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node. */

select b.N, case when b.P is null then 'Root' when b.N in (select P from BST) then 'Inner' else 'Leaf' end as Node from BST b order by b.N
